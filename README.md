# Hello, world! 👋

I'm Chris Boatwright, aka cmbcodes, a passionate self-taught developer from the Carolinas. With about 2 years of overall programming experience, I am moderately proficient in Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS, and have a few months so far in Javascript. Alongside this, I've honed my skills for about six months learning Microsoft PowerApps, while creating a Service Ticketing App using MS SSO and Teams for ease of access.

💼 My professional background is rooted in Global Supply Chain Management, Manufacturing Production Control, and Lean Six Sigma methodologies for process quality. 

🎯 Currently, I'm focusing on transitioning into a full-time programming and development career, aiming to become a full-stack or backend developer and aspire to build mobile apps. 

🔭 What makes me unique is the ability to leverage my past experiences. My skills in business analysis and project management related roles have been and continue to be vital in bridging the gap between customer needs and engineering solutions.
